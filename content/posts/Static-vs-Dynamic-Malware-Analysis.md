## Static vs Dynamic Analysis
Malware analysis is divided into two primary techniques: **static** and **dynamic** analysis.

### Comparison:
| Static Analysis | Dynamic Analysis |
|----------------|------------------|
| Code inspection without execution | Analyzing malware behavior in execution |
| Fast and lightweight | Requires sandbox environment |
| Cannot detect obfuscated code | Can bypass obfuscation |

Understanding when to use each method is key to effective malware analysis. üîç
