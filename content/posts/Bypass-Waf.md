# How to Bypass WAF in 2025: Challenges and Solutions

May 9, 2023 Â·  9 min read

How many times has a site blocked the requests made by your web scraper? Most of the time, that's due to WAFs, application-level firewalls that come with several defense systems to block undesired traffic.

They rely on several advanced techniques, but keep calm! There's always a way to get around them. Here, you'll learn how to bypass WAF protections and scrape any site.

Let's learn how!

## What Does WAF Mean?

WAF stands for  [Web Application Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall)  and is a collection of security tools to protect a site from several attacks and threats. A WAF operates at the application layer of the OSI model. It analyzes HTTP requests and applies a set of rules to identify and block suspicious traffic.

When it comes to web scraping, WAFs represent a major obstacle. That's because scraping requests usually appear as an attack on a WAF, especially when extracting data at a high rate or in large volumes.

## Is It Possible to Bypass a WAF?

Yes, WAF bypass is possible. But since WAFs use many security techniques, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. These are several of the most popular protection methods you need to know how to bypass:

-   **IP Address Reputation**: Blocking requests that come from IPs marked as unreliable or dangerous. You can avoid that with a  [web scraping proxy](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-proxy).
-   **CAPTCHAS**: Problems shown on the web pages that are easy to solve for humans but complex for bots. Learn how to  [bypass CAPTCHA](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-captcha-web-scraping)  or use a  [CAPTCHA proxy](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/captcha-proxies)  to help you circumvent them.
-   **Honeypots**: Traps for bots embedded in web pages that are invisible to human users. Learn more on  [how to bypass a honeypot](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/what-is-honeypot-trap).
-   **User behavior analysis**: Tracking user activity on a web page to determine whether it's a bot. Prevent that by making your scraping bot simulate a human with a  [headless browser](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/headless-browser-scraping).
-   **Device fingerprinting**: Looking for hardware and software features only a real user's device usually has. Dig into  [browser fingerprinting](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting)  and how to win over it.

## What WAF Do I Need to Bypass?

Knowing which WAF your target site relies on is crucial to building an effective web scraper. Follow the steps below to learn how to identify a WAF:

1.  **Explore your target site in the browser**.
2.  **Look for evident protection methods**: Most popular WAFs inform users of what is going on when applying strict anti-bot measures. These control pages usually feature the provider's name, which is essential to know.

Note the "Performance & security by  **Cloudflare**" footer. There, you can also check whether the site uses security solutions such as CAPTCHAs.

3.  **Analyze the HTTP headers**: Open the DevTools, interact with the site, and inspect the HTTP response headers of the requests made by the browser. WAFs tend to make specific AJAX calls and set special headers and cookies. For example, Cloudflare sets the  `cf_clearance cookie`.

If none of the steps above helped you figure out the WAF, try to perform an automated request to your target page. Use an HTTP client and make a  `GET`  request. The response produced by the server may provide useful data:

Take a look at the  `/cdn-cgi/`  route for images. That's typical of Cloudflare and also true for the presence of the  `_cf_chl_opt`  object.

## Popular WAFs You Need to Know

The most popular WAF vendors on the market are few. And because they all adopt different anti-bot protection technologies and security policies, we created specific guides to help you bypass each of them:

-   **Cloudflare**: It offers a suite of security solutions to protect sites from various types of attacks.  [Around 20%](https://blog.cloudflare.com/application-security/)  of all internet websites use it. Learn how to  [b](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-cloudflare)[ypass Cloudflare](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-cloudflare).
-   **Akamai**: It takes advantage of machine learning to block attacks in real time. You'll find how to  [b](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-akamai)[ypass Akamai](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-akamai)  here.
-   **PerimeterX**: It exploits behavioral analysis to protect web applications from many threats. Check out our guide to find step-by-step instructions on how to  [b](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/perimeterx-bypass)[ypass PerimeterX](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/perimeterx-bypass).

No matter what technology your target site employs, you can bypass its WAF with a full-featured web scraping API such as  [ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/).

## Techniques to Bypass WAF

Let's see the best tips and methods to bypass WAF defenses.

### 1. Use Residential IPs

An effective solution to avoid IP banning is making HTTP requests through a proxy server. These typically offer:

-   **Data center IPs**: Addresses coming from data centers and not associated with any ISP.
-   **Residential IPs**: Addresses assigned by ISPs to real devices in a specific location.
-   **Mobile IPs**: Addresses assigned by mobile carriers to individual devices. They're useful for scraping websites that show different content for mobile users.

Datacenter IP addresses are cheap, but most WAFs can spot them without effort. Residential IPs are, instead, much more reliable. Read our guide of the  [best proxy providers for web scraping](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-proxy)  to see a list of great options.

### 2. Run Fortified Headless Browsers

Headless browsers are a great tool for scraping sites that need JavaScript. Yet, their primary purpose is to build automated tests. Thus, they don't try to hide and may set special headers or variables, which helps WAFs recognize their requests.

There are some libraries to override that default behavior. For example,  [`undetected_chromedriver`](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/undetected-chromedriver)  patches Selenium to make it ready for scraping, and  [`puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/puppeteer-stealth)  does the same for Puppeteer and Playwright. They can help you with your WAF bypass.

### 3. Web Scraping API

A scraping API like ZenRows is a great alternative to avoid getting blocked by WAFs. This technology provides premium proxies and implements sophisticated anti-bot techniques, eliminating all headaches.

Suppose you want to build a  [web scraping script in Python](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-python)  to extract data from the G2 review page of Asana, which is protected by Cloudflare:  `https://www.g2.com/products/asana/reviews`

  
If you visit it with Selenium, you'll get the following  [`403 Forbidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403)  page error:

[![G2 Access Denied](https://static.zenrows.com/content/medium_G2_access_denied_cf0914880c.png "G2 Access Denied")](https://static.zenrows.com/content/large_G2_access_denied_cf0914880c.png)

You'll get the Python code below for the  `Proxy`  mode:

program.py

```python
import requests

url = "https://www.g2.com/products/asana/reviews"
proxy = "http://<YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY>:js_render=true&premium_proxy=true@api.zenrows.com:8001"
proxies = {"http": proxy, "https": proxy}
response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies, verify=False)
print(response.text)

```
